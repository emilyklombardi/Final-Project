Is the English Premier League rated and its players overpaid? 
For a long time there has been a lot of speculation if the world's oldest and most popular football league “The Barclays Premier League” is actually the league of the highest level. For a long time teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munchen were dominating international tournaments, which puts forward the question: Is the Premier League overrated?
In order to answer this question, we decided to analyse the relationship between a teams average overall rating and their average weekly wages. 
From the dataset we took the data from the three biggest spending teams in the 5 biggest leagues in the world (England, Spain, Germany, France, Italy). 

When we did this we found out that: 
England: Mean of overall equals 76.50
         Mean of wage equals 99.9
Spain: Mean of overall equals 75.33
       Mean of wage equals 80.50
Germany: Mean of overall equals 75.14
         Mean of wage equals 49.30
France: Mean of overall equals 73.63
        Mean of wage equals 39.90
Italy: Mean of overall equals 79.81
       Mean of wage equals 83.99

So after analyzing this data we came to the conclusion that although England has the highest wage, as we predicted , the second highest wage is almost 16,000 pounds lower than England. The rating of England is the second highest but the other leagues are very similair in terms of overall ranking. We can definately conclude that in terms of overall quality of the league there is not a lot that differentiates them from each other. In terms of the wages however there is a significant difference, the highest paying league is England by far, then comes Italy, then Spain, then Germany, and laslty France. Something very noticeable is that GErmany spends more than half in average wage than England does whilst they maintain an overall ranking that is very similair to England. Also France only spend 40% of the English Premiere League in wages and much like Germany they are maintaining a high overall ranking. 
From these numbers we generally conclude that the English Premiere League is overpaid and that if we were a gamer or a scout we would focus primarily on recruiting from Italy, France, or Germany
If this is true, then we can: 
1: Show the data to not only gamers who will pay less for better player when making their starting 11. 
2. Present the result to international scouts who try to find talented players for little money, they should focus on scouting from SPAIN (IF are theory is true). 

For the second part of our project we asked the question, "Which country produces the overall highest ranking players?" This question can help locate where the highest ranking players originate from, therefore giving some insight for gamers and scouts where to select players from, aside from just what club or team a player plays for.


From analyzing our results we found that Brazil, France, and Italy were the top three countries to recruit from since they had the three highest averages for overall ranking for their country. The res tof the top eight teams in order were Germany, Argentina, Portugal, Spain and England. We found that Brazil had an overall ranking of 83.2, France had an average overall ranking of 82.8, Italy had had an average overall ranking 82.8, Germany had had an average overall ranking 82.7, Argentina had had an average overall ranking 82.5, Portugal had had an average overall ranking 82.4, Spain had had an average overall ranking 82.4, and lastly England had had an average overall ranking 81.6. This shows how although England and Spain may have some of the best teams in the world, the best players in the world seem to be mostly coming from Brazil, France, and Italy.

One challenge that this presented was that we needed to only take the countries into consideration that had atleast 20 players that all had ratings above 80. The reason why we did this is becasue if we used the whole data set then the highest rated countries were really small countries that only had a couple of players in the data set who had high ratings and therefore made the countries overall rating high. An example of this is that if we took the whole data set then Brazil would have only had a rating of 75 becasue there are around 650 Brazilian players compared to Cape Verde who would have had a higher rating of 78 because there were only two players in their data set. 


The third question we created from our data set was "Has medical and technological advances throughout the last 15 years advanced enough to allow older players to stay higher ranked longer throughout their lives than in the past? 

There is a theory in modern day soccer, that players have a longer career today than they did just 15 years ago. This is because of the advancements in the medical field in technology advancements which have made it possible for players to recover from serious injuries. We wanted to test this theory, so we compared the 60 highest rated players of 2019 and 2005 dataset. 

We found out that the average age of the two sets were actually remarkably similar, the average age of top players is 28. Our theory that top players are typically older today than in the past is therefore false. We found that in 2005 the average age within the top 60 was 28.16 while the average age withing the top 60 in 2019 was 28.23. This difference of 0.07 does not show a significant difference in the age group, therefore  scouts and gamers can utilize this data to know that whatever version of the Fifa game that they are playing they'll know that the age range will generally be the same.
